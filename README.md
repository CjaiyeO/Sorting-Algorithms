# Sorting-Algorithms  
  - This is a simple C program that allows you to visualize three sorting algorithms: selection sort, bubble sort, and insertion sort. It prompts the user to input the number of elements and the elements themselves, and then provides options to choose which sorting             algorithm to apply.

# Prerequisites
  -  C Compiler: You need a C compiler installed on your system to compile and execute the program. One commonly used compiler is GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), which is available for various operating systems. If you don't have GCC installed, you can download it from          gcc.gnu.org.
  -  Development Environment: You can write and edit the program code using any text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C programming. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, and Eclipse CDT.
  -  Basic Understanding of C Programming: This program assumes basic knowledge of the C programming language. You should be familiar with concepts such as variables, data types, input/output, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements.
  -  Terminal or Command Prompt: You'll need access to a terminal or command prompt to compile and execute the program. This is where you'll run commands to compile the source code and execute the compiled program.

# How to Use

1. **Compile the Program**: Compile the program using a C compiler. 

2. **Run the Program**: Execute the compiled program.
   
3. **Enter the Number of Elements**: When prompted, enter the number of elements you want to sort.

4. **Enter the Elements**: Input the elements one by one when prompted.

5. **Choose a Sorting Algorithm**: After entering the elements, the program will prompt you to choose a sorting algorithm:
- Enter `1` for selection sort.
- Enter `2` for bubble sort.
- Enter `3` for insertion sort.
- 
6. **View the Sorted Array**: The program will display the sorted array based on the chosen sorting algorithm.

# Available Sorting Algorithms

1. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and placing it at the beginning.
2. **Bubble Sort**: This algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
3. **Insertion Sort**: This algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by repeatedly picking up the next element and inserting it into the sorted part of the array.
